# Components::MosaicManager

Passive component that receives gamma ray detector data from the MOSAIC payload over UART and stores it on disk under `/mosaic` for later downlink.

The MOSAIC payload streams ASCII CSV lines of the form `ADC=<raw>,MV=<millivolts>\n` at 9600 baud, one sample every 100 ms. The manager only listens — it never sends commands to the payload. Power to the payload is controlled separately through the load switch components.

## Design

- Bytes arriving on `dataIn` are accumulated into lines and parsed into raw ADC/millivolts samples.
- The input ports and the commands are **guarded**, not sync. `dataIn` is invoked from the 10 Hz rate group thread, `run` from the 1 Hz rate group thread, and the commands from the command dispatcher thread; all three mutate the open file handle and its counters. Guarding serializes them on the component mutex so a `STOP_RECORDING` or a stale-file flush cannot close the file out from under an in-flight sample write.
- Samples are serialized as fixed-size little-endian binary records (`seconds: U32` time tag, `adc: U16`, `millivolts: U16`, 8 bytes total). `SAMPLES_PER_WRITE` records (10 by default) are buffered in memory and appended to the `Os::File` under `/mosaic` in one write; closing a partial file writes the remaining records first.
- A file is closed when it reaches `SAMPLES_PER_FILE` records (100 by default), when a partially filled file is older than 60 seconds (checked on the 1 Hz rate group), on `FLUSH`, or on `STOP_RECORDING`. The next sample reopens a new file.
- Files are named `/mosaic/gamma_<seq>.dat` and can be downlinked with the existing file downlink chain (via a ground-commanded file send — there is no automatic catalog/scan).
- `seq` is an in-RAM counter that resets to 0 on every reboot, but the Zephyr `Os::File` delegate truncates on `OPEN_CREATE` regardless of the `NO_OVERWRITE` flag (unimplemented upstream). To avoid silently wiping a not-yet-downlinked file from a previous boot, `ensureFileOpen()` probes forward with `Os::FileSystem::getPathType()` for the first `seq` not already present on disk before opening. When `MAX_FILE_COUNT` files (100 by default) are present, the manager emits `MaxFilesReached` and disables recording until `START_RECORDING` is commanded.

## Usage Examples

Turn on the payload power load switch; MOSAIC begins streaming immediately and the manager records samples by default. Use `STOP_RECORDING`/`START_RECORDING` to gate recording, and `FLUSH` to force the partially filled file closed before downlinking.

After downlinking a `gamma_*.dat` file, decode and display it from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/decode_mosaic.py gamma_000000.dat
```

Pass `--utc` to also render the stored seconds as a UTC timestamp, or `--csv` for output that can be redirected into a spreadsheet. The seconds field is Unix time when the spacecraft RTC is available; if the RTC is unavailable, flight software falls back to seconds since boot.

| 2026-07-19 | Fixed cross-reboot file overwrite: probe for an unused file index before opening, since the Zephyr file delegate ignores NO_OVERWRITE |
| 2026-08-03 | Made the input ports and commands guarded; they run on three different threads and raced on the open file handle |
| 2026-08-04 | Batched 10 samples per filesystem write to reduce the write rate from 10 Hz to approximately 1 Hz |
| 2026-08-04 | Made per-file sample count, batch size, and maximum file count configurable parameters |
